# Python_AviationAccident
Purpose
-------

Investigate the aviation accident database and plot the results

Getting Started
-------
Run the downloader.py to download the csv file called 'AviationDataset.csv'. You only have to run the downloader once.

After running the downloader, run all the different QuestionX.py files to generate answer for the different questions given at https://github.com/DaMexicanJustice/frantic_midnight. Each QuestionX.py generates a plot which is saved in the root directory of the project. Each QuestionX.py also prints some answers in the console

Prerequisites
-------
This project requires the following modules to be installed/imported:
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib.pyplot` 
* `pandas`
* `collections`
* `csv`
# Solutions

Questions asked
-------
 * Q1:How do the flight phases (ex. take off, cruise, landing..) contribute to fatalities? Chart!
 * Q2:Which 5 states saw the most injuries in the US? Show it on a barchart! *
 * Q3:Which 5 aircraft models had the most injuries (fatal, serious, minor)? Show them on a piechart!
 * Q4:What was the distribution of fatal injuries during the last 20 years? Show it on a barchart!
 * Q5:[UPDATED] What was the survival rate (how many died / how many survived) for substantially damaged AND destroyed aircrafts since 1993, showing data for each year. Show results on a stacked bar plot. (see more in notebook 14 - Intro to plotting / example 62.) **
